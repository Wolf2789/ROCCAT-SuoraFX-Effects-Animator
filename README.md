_Keep in mind that it's a very basic implementation and a lot of work should (and will) be done here._


## Features
* evaluating Lua code
* scripting effects in Lua
* premade built-in presets of SuoraFX


## Installation
### Dependencies
* gtk+-3.0
* gee-0.8
* gtksourceview-3.0
* lua-5.2
* libusb-1.0

### Building
Simply clone or download & unpack this repo and `make`

This will produce _SuoraFX-Effects-Animator_ executable that should be executed like this:
> `sudo ./SuoraFX-Effects-Animator` or `make run`

You can also make and run at once with `make build_and_run`

## TODO
* add all premade built-in presets
* remapping keys
* effects API
* no keyboard flickering when setting custom preset
